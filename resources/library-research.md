# Library and research assistance

Please apply for a [Harvard Library card](https://libraries.mit.edu/borrow/non-mit-access/harvard/) and use [BorrowDirect](https://libraries.mit.edu/borrow/borrowdirect/)! The Harvard card gives you access to the physical facilities across campus (e.g., studying at the beautiful Law Library, using Harvard buses, etc) and BorrowDirect lets you borrow a book from any library in the network (e.g., Princeton, Stanford, Chicago, etc --- no need to wait for a book in course reserves because you could just get a copy from another library). If you're pressed for time, you can request pick-up online where a lovely librarian will collect all the books you list and you can pick them all up at once at the library of your choosing!

If you use [Zotero](https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-write/zotero) for citation and PDF management (which you should!), your MIT email gives you unlimited cloud storage, with all its environmental implications. You should also avail yourself of the [book acquisition request](https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-write/zotero) form --- the libraries will buy virtually any book you suggest through the form that doesn't already exist in the current catalog. I would also highly recommend the extensive [research support](https://libraries.mit.edu/research-support/) that the libraries offer. Professor T.L. Taylor has this [fantastic guide](http://tltaylor.com/teaching/research-resources-for-students/) that is specific to media studies.
