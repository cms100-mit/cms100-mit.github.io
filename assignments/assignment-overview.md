# Assignment overview

Letter grades are awarded based on the number of points accumulated: A [90-100), B [80-90), C [70-80), D [60-70). If you earn 100 points or more, you'll get an A+. Because of regulations associated with the course’s CI-H designation, you must complete all of the assignments to pass the class. 

[Here](/policies/#ai-writing-assistance) is my complete AI writing assistance policy. In short: you’re allowed to use it, provided that you submit the prompts and dialogues from your sessions (Chat-GPT has a function that allows you to provide a link to the entire chat history), as well as a 200-word reflection on your experience. Submit both as an appendix to your assignments.
