# Assignment 4: Media analysis project (2500 words)

## Assignment 4a: final project proposal (1 slide)
Before next class, please fill in your slide in the shared final project proposal deck with 3 short ideas (1–3 sentences per idea). Be prepared to speak for ~3 min about your idea and give feedback to your colleagues.

**&rarr; &nbsp;Due: Date, submit to [shared deck]().** 

## Assignment 4b: final paper rough draft 
In this paper, you will choose a media topic to systematically gather data about, code (categorize) that data in some way, visualize the data, and analyze your findings. Depending on the media platform(s) you choose to analyze, there are many tools available to help you in these tasks (Google Trends, MediaCloud, PageOneX, Gephi, social media scrapers on Github, etc). Instead of a platform, you can also analyze some media phenomenon. You can gather data about this phenomenon through any of the qualitative (interviews, observations), quantitative, or experimental methods that you’ve learned about this semester. Please use the file naming convention from the previous assignments.
